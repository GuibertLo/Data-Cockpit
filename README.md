## Introduction

Data-Cockpit is a suite of integrated software tools designed for configuring, executing, and visualizing digital experiments. A digital experiment involves running a software application based on predefined hypotheses and parameters to perform calculations and generate results. Experiment plans involve multiple runs of the software with varying configurations, enabling users to compare the impact of different parameters, hypotheses, or strategies on the outcomes.

Data-Cockpit facilitates the entire process, from the setup and execution of experiments to the analysis of data generated by Java programs.
